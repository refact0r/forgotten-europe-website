		<h1>Legislation</h1>

		<p>
			After months of work with the office of Washington State Senator Claire Wilson, we
			drafted a senate resolution acknowledging every April as genocide awareness and
			prevention month. Elements of this resolution were incorporated into HB 2037 and SB
			5851, both two bills in the Washington State Legislature that mandate genocide education
			in K-12 schools. Our project remains dedicated to supporting inclusive, diverse, and
			meaningful genocide education standards across Washington.
