description: Beginning in 1991, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
  entered a devastating decade-long civil war. Nationalism and ethnic tension
  between the six Yugoslav republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
  Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia) was fostered by unscrupulous
  politicians, escalating to mass displacement, ethnic cleansing, and genocide.
