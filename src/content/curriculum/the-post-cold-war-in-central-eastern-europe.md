description: At the end of the Cold War in 1991, various nations in Central and
  Eastern Europe were liberated from Soviet hegemony. In the tumultuous years
  afterwards, some realigned geopolitically with the West, while others fell
  under the rising hegemony of the Russian Federation.

This lesson plan for 2-3 45-60-minute class periods will cover the political, economic, and geopolitical directions which select Soviet satellites/Socialist Republics–specifically the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; Poland; Belarus; and Czechoslovakia–went after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Students will create class presentations in groups based on research on each of the four focus states/groups of states. Then, each group will present on their focus state/group of states, while other class members will take notes on the graphic organizer. The content below provides brief introductions for each focus state/group of states for the teacher to review and recommended resources for students to explore. Students may explore additional resources, although they should stay focused on their assigned state/group of states and the 1989-2009 timeframe.
