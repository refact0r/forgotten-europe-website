description: "On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation began a full-scale
  invasion of Ukraine. Disguised by Russian authorities as a “special military
  operation,” the ongoing war has devastated the Ukrainian nation and people.
  Global stability, international alliances, and the post-Cold War peace are
  continually challenged as the conflict drags on. "

This 2-part lesson plan provides elementary school students with an interactive and engaging introduction to the effects of the war in Ukraine. The first section focuses on developing a contextual understanding of the war and ongoing refugee crisis. The second and final section is centered around the children’s picture book: The Yellow Butterfly–inspired by the ongoing events in Ukraine. Both sections encourage students to inquire on how distant events and conflicts affect local communities. Lesson material is aimed towards elementary school students (grades 3-5) with a basic understanding of immigration.
