description: On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation began a full-scale
  invasion of Ukraine. Disguised by Russian authorities as a “special military
  operation,” the ongoing war has devastated the Ukrainian nation and people.
  Global stability, international alliances, and the post-Cold War peace are
  continually challenged as the conflict drags on.
