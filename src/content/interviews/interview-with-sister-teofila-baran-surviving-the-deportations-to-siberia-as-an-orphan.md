Teofila Baran, born in Southeastern Poland, awoke one night to Soviet soldiers pounding on her door. That was the start of a 6 year long journey across Siberia and Central-Asia where her family died in the Gulag labor camp system. Luckily, she--along with thousands of other Polish exiles--was saved by an Indian ruler known as the Good Maharaja. Today, she is a nun at a Polish abbey in Rome.
