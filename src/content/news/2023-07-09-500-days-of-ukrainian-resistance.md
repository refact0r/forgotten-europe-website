On February 24, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tens of thousands have died since with many more wounded, including both soldiers and civilians. Although the exact casualty count varies among sources, it is undeniable that Putin’s actions are of serious humanitarian concern. Ukrainian resistance, however, stands strong under the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who recently marked the struggle’s 500th day with a video of his visit to Snake Island in Ukraine’s southern waters.

*Moskva*, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, sailed to Snake Island hours after the invasion began and ordered the stationed Ukrainian soldiers to surrender. In the subsequent radio exchange, the response, “Russian warship, go f*ck yourself,” became a viral instance of Ukrainian defiance and heroism. Russian forces then seized Snake Island, which was recaptured by Ukraine during June the same year.

In the video, Zelenskyy declares Snake Island to be a “place of victory”, solidifying its symbolism as progress towards Ukrainian de-occupation. Such efforts see sustained support from the US, which recently defended its controversial cluster munitions package to aid the resistance effort. Additionally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is expected to be a major subject of discussion at the upcoming NATO summit at Vilnius, Lithuania.

However, these last 500 days of Ukrainian resilience also marks 500 days of Ukrainian suffering. Considering civilians alone, the UN estimates at minimum 9,000 have died since the war began. Russia’s missile and drone attacks have most recently taken eight lives in Lyman, a key railroad hub. These continued humanitarian violations make it only more imperative to stand with Ukraine as they repel Putin’s invasion.
