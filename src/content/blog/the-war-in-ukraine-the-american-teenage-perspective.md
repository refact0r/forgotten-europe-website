Mothers alone with their children and few belongings, their husbands left to fight on the front. Parents frantically making calls, to host families, shelters, and perhaps more importantly, to family still trapped in Ukraine while children run and play games. This was the scene that greeted me at the city of Krakow’s Ukrainian reception center in Poland. An old train station, with its chandeliers and historic design, had become the host for the suffering and pain that Putin’s war brought to the Ukrainian people.

I live in Bellevue and currently attend Interlake High School as a sophomore. Recently, I had the unique opportunity to spend a week as a volunteer at Krakow’s refugee reception center, as a way for me, to contribute to the war effort.

This is my experience and message to Washingtonians.

From a personal standpoint, as a Polish American, I have a direct interest in the conflict in Ukraine. Whether it be from Ukrainian family friends to Polish News outlets, the conflict has extended beyond Ukraine’s border and touched my own life. While from a Bellevue perspective the war seems remote, in the eyes of Poles who have suffered from two pervious global wars and decades of Soviet oppression, the possibility of a spillover is extremely plausible and scary.

Given this understanding of the region’s history, the creation of such reception and refugee camps along the Ukrainian border became a moral obligation for the Polish people. Poles understand what it means to suffer from repression and war, and they quickly expressed sympathy to the Ukrainian people who suffered the same tragedy. Whatever happened in Ukraine, could also potentially happen in Poland and the rest of the world. I had to help.

Despite their current grim reality, most refugees I talked to believed that Ukraine would still win. I asked one woman what would happen if Russia succeeded, she quickly responded, “We won’t talk about if Ukraine loses, because Ukraine will win.” There was never discussion of a scenario in which Ukraine would lose; victory was the only option. Only victory could ensure freedom and safety for the Ukrainian people. One woman described how she was planning to defy her husband’s demands and instead take the train back to Kyiv. Others I talked to also said they were at the center not to escape the war, but to return to Ukraine by train, regardless of the risk.  

The week I volunteered, Russia conducted massive missile strikes around Ukraine’s August 24th Independence Day, which caused an influx in refugee arrivals. The reception center was the first major train stop after departing Ukraine. I spent time passing out bed sheets, food, and sim cards to shaken refugees from Ukraine. No matter how much suffering such strikes caused back home for them, many of these refugees expressed their resolve to defend a free Ukraine.

Working at the center, I began to understand what it truly meant to be dedicated to a cause. The center maintained a storage with hundreds of donated sleeping bags. Supervised by a young Ukrainian man who worked for the city, we volunteers carefully selected the best bags for shipment to soldiers fighting in the Ukrainian eastern front. The supervisor described how we had to scrutinize each bag before shipment as, he only wanted “the warmest, darkest, and best for our soldiers.” Although it took hours to separate and check each sleeping bag, we understood that our choices could affect the lives and safety of soldiers currently in combat. When one’s home is in danger, many would dedicate anything to save it, even in the form of sleeping bags.

In between my volunteer commitments, I had time to converse with refugees, perhaps the most unique part of my volunteer experience. Blending words from both Ukrainian and Polish, I regularly enjoyed these discussions. English was always an alternative for those who knew it. This minimal form of communication kept topics simple but grounded in reality. It is important to understand that in every refugee exists a unique story and that the consequences of Putin’s war affect real individuals with real lives. Some described their plans and hopes to reach safety abroad with host families. Others described the devastation and destruction that the war has left behind. Each was forever impacted by their experience.

Perhaps most tragic was the presence of so many children who, despite their age had to face the chaos and devastation most adults never experience. Traveling alone with their mothers, they ran and played throughout the halls. Sometimes these children came alone, one refugee pointed out a little girl whose parents were the victims of war crimes. There was one boy named Roman who I sat and converse with before he left to “stay with grandmother in Berlin.” Using two broken rackets, we played badminton, discussed school, friends, his home in Ukraine, anything to avoid the topic of war and brutality. These children are victims, and even at this young age they understand the meaning of war and conflict from first-hand perspective.

The international reaction, condemnation, and aid has been a critical component to Ukraine’s successful repulsion of the invasion. The diverse backgrounds of volunteers represent the international scope of the response. During my week, I met Americans, Canadians, Azerbaijanis, Croatians, Palestinians, Poles, and of course, Ukrainians working as volunteers to the refugee effort. This war is truly grounded in global roots.

More importantly, widespread awareness of the conflict is critical to preserve the focus and support for Ukraine’s victory. What happens in Ukraine impacts the rest of humanity. As the daily protests in Krakow’s old square reminded us, “while we enjoy peace and stability, Ukrainian soldiers are dying daily for our freedom.” In a world with NATO and collective defense, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raises the real possibility of global war. Only continued support and awareness, even from as far away as tranquil Bellevue, can ensure a Ukrainian victory and a step towards peace.
