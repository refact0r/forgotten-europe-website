An ordinary Wednesday morning scene: the sun rising, employees clocking in, children going to school. By the bright-and-early hour of 9 a.m., eight of these children are shot and killed. Not 36 hours later, another shooting strikes two towns in Belgrade. These last few months have seen mass protest not only in Serbia, but with the Serbian international diaspora as well. It has been one of the nation’s most tense periods in the 21st century.

Huge demonstrations have filled the streets of Belgrade, Serbia’s capital city. They demand the resignation of important politicians, gun control policy reform, and modifications to Serbian media, all of which they believe has fostered a culture of violence.

Many of these protestors argue that the culture of violence is rooted in nationalist thought and media which celebrates criminal life from during the nationalists’ strongest era. These claims are thought-provoking, especially given the region’s rocky history— namely, the decades of war from which Central and Eastern Europe are still reeling.

So what exactly is behind the growing popular resentment of Serbia’s nationalist culture?

Let’s begin with the stories of each event.

### The Belgrade School Shooting
On 3 May 2023, at 8:30 a.m., Vladislav Ribnikar Elementary School’s daily routine was disrupted by 13-year-old Kosta Kecmanović opening fire inside of a classroom. One student who was present relates the chilling story through her father, Milan Milošević, who describes that Kecmanović “first shot the teacher and then started shooting randomly.” Another witness recounts seeing “kids running out from the school, screaming.”

“Perhaps the most horrifying experience I have had as a doctor and as a human being.” — Minister of Health Danica Grujičić

Owing to the rarity of events like this, the school drew immediate federal attention. Minister of Education Branko Ružić called a three-day period of mourning, and Minister of Health Danica Grujičić lamented it as “perhaps the most horrifying experience I have had as a doctor and as a human being.” Interior Minister Bratislav Gašić kept tabs on the aftermath, noting that eight children and a security guard were killed. Another six students and a teacher were injured. On the local level, Belgrade’s University Hospital treated three students and one teacher. One of the students later succumbed to her injuries. Local investigation by the Belgrade police force revealed a shocking truth: that Kecmanović had been planning the shooting in detail for at least a month prior.

Authorities uncovered hit lists and detailed plans of attack. The gun used was Kecmanović’s father’s, who had improperly secured the weapon in a safe. Mr. Kecmanović has since been detained for grave acts against public security, a criminal proceeding still under investigation. Authorities fault him for training his son in the usage of firearms.

Kosta Kecmanović’s justification has been one chilling sentence: “I shot because I am a psychopath.”

In the wake of these findings, protests against the government’s failure to act began to stir. The next day, however, only magnified these demonstrations.

### The Mladenovac and Smederevo Shootings
21-year-old Uroš Blažić returned home to his cottage in Šepšin after an argument with his friends at a Mladenovac football stadium. But he did not stay there for long. Taking an assault rifle, three pistols, and four hand grenades, he expressed his rage via a drive-by shooting. His first destination was a village in Smederevo. There, Blažić shot 11, killing five and injuring six. He then continued to a town in Mladenovac, killing another four and injuring a handful of other civilians.

The subsequent manhunt took the region by storm. The Serbian government engaged 600 members of the Special Forces, an anti-terrorism unit, a helicopter unit, and Belgrade and Smederevo’s municipal police forces. After several mistaken arrests, authorities finally captured him during the morning of 5 May.

In the wake of Blažić’s arrest, investigations have uncovered shocking details. He was arrested wearing a shirt printed with the slogan “Generation 88 on Tour,” a pro-Nazi symbol.
